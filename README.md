# BayRide

## Bayride is the new standard for ride-sharing. It differentiates itself from all other apps in a number of ways. It is the only app of its kind that allows for payment with digital currencies, and the only one to have its own digital currency, designed specifically for improving the experience of everyone using Bayride. The diverse payment options available ensure that everyone can operate comfortably.

## Bayride also sets the new industry standard for safety. It vets all drivers, and also includes several emergency features, such as single-click 911 calls and several strategic business alliances.

## Bayride is also the best-priced option--for both drivers and passengers. It avoids the greed of other ride-sharing platforms by taking a step back. Bayride takes no fees on any trip, ever. This means more money for drivers. When drivers are offered the opportunity to give rides that are 30-40% higher than they would be on an opposing platform, they will happily compete in order to secure these deals. In the end, both parties can be happy knowing that they were better served than they would have otherwise been.
